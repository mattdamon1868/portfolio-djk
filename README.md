**Abstract:**

*Extremum seeking control (ESC) often employs perturbation-based estimates of derivatives for some  sensor field or cost function. These estimates are generally obtained by simply multiplying the      output of a single-unit sensor by some time-varying function. Previous work has focused on sinusoidal perturbations to generate derivative estimates with results for arbitrary order derivatives of scalar maps or higher order derivatives of multivariable maps.  This work extends the perturbations from sinusoidal to bounded periodic or almost periodic functions and considers multivariable maps. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for determining if time-varying functions exist for estimating arbitrary order derivatives of multivariable maps for any given bounded periodic or almost periodic dither signal. These results are then used in a source seeking controller for a nonholonomic vehicle with a sensor actuated by servo. The conducted simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that by distributing the local map exploration to a servo, the nonholonomic vehicle was able to achieve a faster convergence to the source.*
   
# Projects

1) Thesis project
- gps-denied environment working with non-holonomic vehicle dynamics for mobile autonomous vehicle
- lead the project for a robot to use an adaptive control theory extremum seeking to take a scalar signal and get the gradient in order to find the maximum point for our cost value meaning we want to get the maximum value of something like light or sound. these are the sources that we worked with
